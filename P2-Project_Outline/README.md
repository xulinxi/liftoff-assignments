This will connect to a dictionray and allow users to interact with a communithy of learners. Users will be able to view the Word of the Day, provide input on if they learned something useful through a tracked reaction feature, comment on the word of the day (including edit and delete features), save words to a personal deck, share their decks with other users, and use a flashcard feature with their decks to study words that they've saved.
